# Special Topic: The javadoc Utility
The **javadoc** utility formats documentation comments into a neat set of documents that you can view in a web browser. It makes good use of the seemingly repetitive phrases. The first sentence of each method comment is used for a summary table of all methods of your class (_see Figure 9.4.1_).

The **@param** and **@return** comments are neatly formatted in the detail description of each method (see Figure 9.4.2). If you omit any of the comments, then **javadoc** generates documents that look strangely empty.

This documentation format may look familiar. It is the same format that is used in the official Java documentation. The programmers who implement the Java library use javadoc themselves. They too document every class, every method, every parameter, and every return value, and then use **javadoc** to extract the documentation.

Many integrated programming environments can execute **javadoc** for you. Alternatively, you can invoke the **javadoc** utility from a shell window, by issuing the command

**javadoc MyClass.java**

The **javadoc** utility produces files such as **MyClass.html** in HTML format, which you can inspect in a browser. You can use hyperlinks to navigate to other classes and methods.

You can run **javadoc** before implementing any methods. Just leave all the method bodies empty. Don’t run the compiler—it would complain about missing return values. Simply run **javadoc** on your file to generate the documentation for the public interface that you are about to implement.

The **javadoc** tool is wonderful because it does one thing right: It allows you to put the documentation _together with your code_. That way, when you update your programs, you can see right away which documentation needs to be updated. Hopefully, you will update it right then and there. Afterward, run **javadoc** again and get updated information that is timely and nicely formatted.
